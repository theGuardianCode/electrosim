## Charged Particle Interactions
A simulator of electrostatics. You can place electrons, protons, and neutrons which attract and repel each other with a force given by coulomb's law.

- **Left-click:** Creates a particle at the mouse position.
- **Right-click:** Cycles the particle that will be placed. Electron -> Neutron -> Proton.
- **Space:** Pause and resume the simulation.
- **R:** Restart the simulation
